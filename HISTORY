VDR Plugin 'permashift' Revision History
---------------------------------------------------

2015-04-25: Version 1.0.3

- Fixed a resource leak (including possibly loads of memory). This has been 
  reported, described in detail and fixed(!) by 'blau-sls' at vdr-portal.de.
  Kudos!

2015-02-28: Version 1.0.2

- added patch for new stable VDR series 2.2

2014-11-30: Version 1.0.1

- Fixed bug sending way too many syslog messages when buffer is full. 
  Thanks to 'z421' at vdr-portal.de for pointing out.
- Reversed the logic of the save on-the-fly option, so hopefully it is 
  easier to understand.
- Changed VDR patch to avoid using default parameters for methods, 
  so this version should be easier to patch and integrate (no rebuilding
  of other plugins anymore)
- Additional translations:
  * Russian by Walter T.
  * Finish by Marko Mäkelä
  * Dutch by Cedric Dewijs

2014-08-16: Version 1.0.0

- Finally release version 1.0

2014-05-24: Version 1.0.0b3

- Fixed 64 bit issues for buffers >= 2 GB

2014-05-24: Version 1.0.0b1

- Quick rewinding into buffer implemented. Beta version.

2014-02-24: Version 0.6.0b1

- Rewrote Permashift to use memory buffer, beta version

2013-05-28: Version 0.5.4

- Plugin waited too long for user input when inactivity was due
  (resulting in a watchdog panic), and it didn't reset activity state.
- Power button didn't (easily) power down VDR, this was a regression in 
  version 0.5.1.
- Thanks to MegaX at vdr-portal for bugging me until I fixed these bugs.
- Only accept timeshift length if it's a number (thanks to mini73).

2013-04-03: Version 0.5.3

- Length of permanent timeshift recording wasn't restored on restart; 
  thanks to MegaX at vdr-portal for finding the bug

2013-03-30: Version 0.5.2

- Length of permanent timeshift recording changeable by user between 1 and 23 hours.
- i18n implemented, translated user visible strings to German.

2013-01-19: Version 0.5.1

- Moved stuff to allow automatic shutdown from VDR patch to plugin.
  Now the plugin asks the user if it should continue to record if he has been inactive too long.
  If the user does not react, permanent timeshift is stopped (thus markad stops to work at its 
  recording as well) and shutdown may take place. Thanks to mini73 at VDR Portal for his suggestions.

2013-01-05: Version 0.5.0beta2

- Initial public revision.
