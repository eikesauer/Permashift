Description:
Permashift saves the TV channel shown live into a ring buffer in RAM.
Thus VDR can rewind from live TV or prepend video from the past to
an instant recording. VDR needs certain modifications (contained in
the file vdr-patch-for-permashift.diff) to make use of the plugin.

Caution:
Permashift can be configured to use lots of RAM and it can create a lot 
of stress for slow HDs. If VDR or anything else on your system becomes 
choppy or crashes or anything, it might be due to too much RAM taken by 
permashift. Lower the settings in this case. If immediate fast rewinding 
from live view does not work well on your system, enable the option to
block rewinding while saving in permashift's options.
